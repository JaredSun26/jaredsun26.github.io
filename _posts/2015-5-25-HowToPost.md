title: "A Post of How to Post with R+knitr+Jekyll"
---
Good tools are a must for good job. In this post, I want to talk about the new workflow I am following to write a post using *R+knitr+Jekyll*. This blog is both a tutorial and an example using the aforementioned tools to craft a blog post. 

I would assume you are comfortable with drafting in R markdown with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). With the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you can turn your R markdown file into blog posts on GitHub. Here is how I did it.

###Take a Look at Your Github Page

Are you aware that you get one site per GitHub account and organization? Check [this](https://pages.github.com/) out. The GitHub page is a perfect place to host your personal blogs. The address of your GitHub page is yourgithubusername.github.io.

###Set Up Your Blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Thanks to the wonderful tool [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), I set up my own GitHub blog in less than one minute. Basically, you just need to fork [this repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io. And your github blog should be up running! You can start customizing and view your site by modifying the files in the repo.
Check out the detailed tutorials [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md)

###Start Writing A Blog

You can start writing your blog in R studio using knitr just as usual. For example, I just generated some random normal numbers

```r
set.seed(1)
x<-rnorm(10)
```
There are 10 numbers here.

###Problems with plots and figures

If you check the markdown file generated by *knitr*, you will notice that the plots are stored in  *figure* folder by default. But Jekyll uses *images* folder to store the figures. To correct this difference, we need to change the chunk option at the begining using:

```r
library("knitr")
opts_knit$set(fig.path="/images/")
```

Now, I can draw my plots:

```r
plot(x)
```

I use the following code to generate a markdown file from the Rmarkdown file I am working on:


```r
knit2html("2015-5-25-HowToPost.Rmd")
```

After copying the output file "2015-5-25-HowToPost.md" to *_posts* folder in the repo,
I copy everything inside *figure* folder in my working directory to the *images* folder in the repo. Similarly for the figures, you can either put them inside *images* folder, or refer to their URLs. (e.g. you can put the image in *public* folder of your [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and copy its public link in the right click menu).

Now, the post is ready to view. Not hard at all, right?
